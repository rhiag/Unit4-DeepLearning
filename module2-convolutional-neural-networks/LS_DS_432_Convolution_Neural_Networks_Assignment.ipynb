    "Stretch goals\n",
    "- Enhance your code to use classes/functions and accept terms to search and classes to look for in recognizing the downloaded images (e.g. download images of parties, recognize all that contain balloons)\n",
    "- Check out [other available pretrained networks](https://tfhub.dev), try some and compare\n",
    "- Image recognition/classification is somewhat solved, but *relationships* between entities and describing an image is not - check out some of the extended resources (e.g. [Visual Genome](https://visualgenome.org/)) on the topic\n",
    "- Transfer learning - using images you source yourself, [retrain a classifier](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/image_retraining) with a new category\n",
    "- (Not CNN related) Use [piexif](https://pypi.org/project/piexif/) to check out the metadata of images passed in to your system - see if they're from a national park! (Note - many images lack GPS metadata, so this won't work in most cases, but still cool)\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources\n",
    "- [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) - influential paper (introduced ResNet)\n",
    "- [YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) - an influential convolution based object detection system, focused on inference speed (for applications to e.g. self driving vehicles)\n",
    "- [R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO](https://towardsdatascience.com/r-cnn-fast-r-cnn-faster-r-cnn-yolo-object-detection-algorithms-36d53571365e) - comparison of object detection systems\n",
    "- [Common Objects in Context](http://cocodataset.org/) - a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset\n",
    "- [Visual Genome](https://visualgenome.org/) - a dataset, a knowledge base, an ongoing effort to connect structured image concepts to language"
